# 552. Student Attendance Record II 
# Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance records 
# with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may be very large, 
# return it after mod 109 + 7.
# 
# A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:
# 
# 'A' : Absent.
# 'L' : Late.
# 'P' : Present.
# A record is regarded as rewardable if 
# it doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) 
# or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 2
# Output: 8 
# Explanation:
# There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
# "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
# Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times. 
# Note: The value of n won't exceed 100,000.
